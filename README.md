# Algorithm-Visualizar
The Algorithm The Visualizer is an interactive project that uses illustrations to make complicated algorithms easier to understand. It enables users to observe in real time the step-by-step operation of algorithms such as pathfinding, sorting, and searching. It serves developers, educators, and learners with its simple design and configurable settings. By making abstract ideas simpler to understand, the tool improves comprehension and problem-solving abilities. It's a practical method to discover the wonders of algorithms, regardless of your level of experience.
